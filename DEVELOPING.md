# DEVELOPING

### Developing of katran

This guide contains information on how you can build and test katran's
BPF forwarding plane and cpp library to control it.

### Formating:

We are using clang-format for C++ code formatting. Please make sure that code is properly
formatted before sending PR. You can format it with `clang-format -i <path/to/file>`
(if your linux distribution does not have clang-format installed, you can use one from the 
deps folder: `./deps/clang/clang+llvm-5.0.0-linux-x86_64-ubuntu16.04/bin/clang-format`)

### Build and compile.

You can build initial version with `build_katran.sh` script (if you are using
ubuntu 18.04). It will download all required dependencies as build
actual binaries. However, you can build everything separately.

### BPF forwarding plane

To be able to build BPF forwarding plane you need to run
`build_bpf_modules_opensource.sh` from the root of the working directory. It assumes
that you have all dependencies installed and that the linux kernel source code
is located at `deps/linux/` (__Note:__ It is automatically installed there with the script: `build_katran.sh`).
The result of this script will be object files w/ BPF programs, which are going
to be located in `deps/linux/bpfprog/bpf/`. These files are:

1. __`balancer_kern.o`__ - object file w/ main BPF program for forwarding
2. __`healthchecking_ipip.o`__ - object file w/ BPF program for the forwarding of
healthchecks

### C++ library

To be able to build C++ library (and examples) you need to:

1. create (if not exists already) __`build dir`__
2. run `cmake ..` inside this __`build dir`__

## Testing

### C++ library
If you are adding new features into C++ library, please make sure that you also submit
unittests for them (all BPF specific calls should be added into `if(!testing_){...}` block
as they require root access (most of the time). You can run unittests manually or w/ ctest
util.

```

### BPF

We have developed special framework for the BPF program testing. It is based on
`bpf_prog_test_run`. This framework allow us to specify predefined test fixtures (input and expected output)
to make sure that for specified input BPF program produces expected output. Test fixtures in our case contains
base64 encoded packets. You can check `katran/lib/testing/KatranTestFixtures.h` for examples. To run this tests
you just need to run `./os_run_tester.sh` script (this script requires root privileges)

```
